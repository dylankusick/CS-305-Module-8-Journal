    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial was a client that I took on in an assignment that wanted to secure their clients information. Initially, they wanted to see the vulnerabilities in their  RESTful web application, so I did dependency checks and worked through the best course of action to fix the problems. Then, we later added a file verification step through the use of a checksum. 


    
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I did very well at suppressing the false positives in their vulnerability report. This step was something I was able to grasp early on and it made the rest of the assignments a lot easier. It is importand to code securely to ensure the physical, and financial safety of anyone that uses an application. Overall, good security is going to make a company look better and make the clients feel better as they will feel safer. 


    
    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
It was difficult to seperate the amount of vulnerabilities in the report. There were so many to record, so recording them had to be done in one go to ensure all of them were accounted for. 


    
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I was able to increase security by adding file verification and a hashing algorithm to their web application. I would probably use the same techniques as I did in this process as all of the algorithms and techniques were not far outdated and were used in a way that would ensure all vulnerabilities were found and taken care of. 


    
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I was able to run the application after refactoring the code to ensure changes were made. I used an algorithm to hash a sentence, and then displayed the sentence to ensure I did that step correctly. 


    
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The Maven dependency check was something that I found to be extremely interesting, even though it was sort of difficult for me to set up at first. This dependency check will ensure that my code is not ready for hackers to breach my system. 


    
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Future employers should understand that coding is not enough, and that coding securely is something to be taken seriously. Future employers may see my value for security that I was able to showcase in this assignment.
